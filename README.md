## Recommendations
It was noted that there was a drop in prices for some food categories such as pulses, oils and fats, cereals and tubers. It was also noted that there was an increase in prices for some food categories such as milk and dairy. Hence, Covid 19 affected food prices in Kenya during the period of study.

Due to the changes in prices during the infection of Covid 19, we therefore recommend that Kenyans, producers, consumers, government agencies etc should put in place mechanisms and policies such as food security policy, price regulations etc that will cushion them in the event of another pandemic in future.
